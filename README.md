# Conditionally Acyclic CO-Networks for Efficient Preferential Optimization

How to run the experiment:

- make sure you have a version of Python 3
- make sure you have the Pandas library installed (you can run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if necessary)
- install system packages to get the `p7zip` and `zstd` commands. On Debian, you can do `sudo apt install p7zip zstd`
- execute the `run.sh` script

You can also visualize the CO-nets architecture with `xdot models/renault_small.dot` for example (you may need to install a package that provides `xdot`).
