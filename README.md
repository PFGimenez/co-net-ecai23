# Conditionally Acyclic CO-Networks for Efficient Preferential Optimization

## Dependencies

- Python 3 with pandas (run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if necessary)
- Compression algorithms: you can probably install them with your package manager. For example, on a Debian-based distro, you can do `sudo apt install p7zip-full zstd lz4 brotli zpaq mscompress`

## Experiment

To run the experiment and replicate the results, execute the `run.sh` script. It can take a minute.

You can visualize the CO-nets architecture with `xdot models/renault_small.dot` for example (you may need to install a package that provides `xdot`).
